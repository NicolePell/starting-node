Bowling with Node.js
====================

A multi-player bowling game to learn the MEAN stack.

- [ ] Has bowlers
- [ ] Each bowler has ten frames
- [ ] Frames one to nine contain one to two rolls
- [ ] The tenth frame can contain up to three rolls (the bonus roll follows a strike or spare in the tenth)
- [ ] A strike happens when all ten pins are destroyed with the first ball
- [ ] A spare happens when all ten pins are destroyed with the second ball
- [ ] An open happens when one or more pins are still standing after the second ball

Scoring
-------
- [ ] A strike earns 10 points plus the points of the next two balls thrown (e.g. if a player got a strike then followed with a 7 then 2, their value for the strike frame would be 10+7+2, or 19.)
- [ ] A spare earns 10 points plus the points for the next ball thrown (e.g. if a player gets a spare then follows it with 7 pins down on the first ball of the next frame, their value for the spare frame would be 10+7, or 17)
- [ ] Open frames count the value of the pinfall in that frame only (e.g. if a player knocks down 5 on their first ball and 3 on their second, the open frame would be worth 8 points.)
- [ ] Maximum score in tenpin bowling is 300, this consists of 12 strikes in a row in one game. This is known as the perfect game.
